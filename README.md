# Workday Planner
 
For this project, I aim to improve the functionality of a standardized work day planner.  This planner will enable its user to track their lists in real-time using the moment library. My main motivation for this project is to utilize Bootstrap, jQuery, and moment to create an easy funtioning planner that saves its data in local storage and appeals to its users.  To ensure the accessiblity of the app, there will be a visually appealing coclor contrast that reresents the past, present and future. Being able to accomplish this workday planner will increase the productivity of any user's day.    

# Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
